# Drowsy-Driver-Detection-
Utilizes a Kaggle dataset of facial images, machine learning and convolutional neural networks to determine if an image displays a potential drowsy driver

## All Project Information is in the poster and in attached demo video
### Dataset Used
Kaggle Drowsy Driving Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dheerajperumandla/drowsiness-dataset

#### data preparation:
To examine the full facial features of a face in a loaded image, it was decided that it would be best to analyze just the images contained 
in the "yawn" and "no yawn" folders, as the closed eye and open eye images included only images of the eye
